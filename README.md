## Code Refactor - Horiseon

Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. is a marketing agency that focuses soley on their client's online pressence.

Refactored Horiseon's landing page to make it more SEO friendly by taking out some divs and adding sementics. Added a more descriptive title to the webpage. Restructured the names of some id's and classes to make it more visually appealing for other devs to work on in the future. Also, added some comments for that purpose as well. CSS was compressed by creating one class and calling that class multiple times to style different parts of the html, vs. multiple classes called throughout the CSS stylesheet for the same style.
